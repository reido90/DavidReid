            My name is David Reid and I am 29 year old web developer from a town
            called Ballymena in Northern Ireland.

            When I am not developing on the web, I love to follow Manchester
            United and the Seattle Seahawks. I am a big fan of Marvel films,
            Apple products, Mountain Dew (the real American one) and Boojum
            burritos. I also love local politics and I tweet too much about it

            Three years ago I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and because of
            this, I am now an activist for Crohn's and Colitis awareness,
            sharing my story and helping others who have been diagnosed.

            I first learnt how to code when I was at school but I then went off
            to university and studied different things. While working for a

            I started with their HTML + CSS course. I then taught myself PHP and
            how to develop WordPress sites. Most of the projects I have worked
            on have been WordPress products including various e-commence sites.
            I also have great experience in developing themes for Shopify. I
            love thrill of selling online.

            Recently I have been working on my Javascript skills and working
            with React, hence how I discovered GatsbyJS as a framework to
            creating super fast applications (just like this one!). I have
            recently started messing with React Native so I can write both
            Android and iPhone apps at the same time. (I mean if it's good
            enough for Facebook and Instagram <span role="img">üòÅ</span>...)
